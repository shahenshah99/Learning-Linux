The "Learning Linux" Shell
========================

</p>

To help you become a bit more acquainted with the [Linux][Linux] [command-line], the [`bash`][bash] shell, a _prototype_ idea is to let you interact with a "Learning Linux" shell, which tries to kind of hold your hand and guide you through running commands and learning different concepts in [Linux].

It is ___not___, by any means, a complete product or a one-size-fits-all utility. The hope is to see if this works well as a teaching tool -- if it fails and turns out to be a flop, we will move on from it or try a new tactic.

_But_, it is my hope, that this interactive tool will help ingrain commands and syntax into your head, and you will gain a better understanding of how things all fit together in the command-line. Please give feedback, comments, concerns and criticisms as they come to you.

__If this tool does turn out to be a success, I will add more content and "modules" to it as the weeks develop.__

---------------

Files & Directory Information
--------

* [`training_wheels`](training_wheels)
    
    This is the main file of the __Training Wheels__ application. It is the most top-level [Python] script that creates and invokes all the other objects that allows the utility to run smoothly -- __this is the executable the user should run when they intend on using the program.__ It is to be excecuted by:

    ```
    ./training_wheels
    ```

* [`shell/`](shell/)
    
    This folder contains the "main loop" of the __Training Wheels__ tool and simulates the "shell," as is the point of the whole application. It handles the commands specific to the __Training Wheels__ shell and acts as the master object for all the code and objects given in the modules noted below.

* [`lessons/`](lessons/)
    
    This directory holds the backend [Python] source code to manage the "lessons" in the __Training Wheels__ shell, and contains the [`hjson`][hjson] and [JSON] files for the lessons themselves. It does act as a [Python] package and is necessary for __Training Wheels__ to run.

* [`save_engine/`](save_engine/)
    
    This folder contains the code to manage the saving and loading of the user's progress throughout their time with __Training Wheels__. It does act as a [Python] package and is necessary for __Training Wheels__ to run.

* [`colors/`](colors/)
    
    This folder acts as a [Python] package that offers the use of the [`colorama`][colorama] module with some convenient and easy-to-access shorthand functions. 

* [`_developer_`](_developer_)
    
    This directory holds code that is meant to be utilized by someone who plans on developing content for the __Training Wheels__ shell -- it includes some [`bash`][bash] scripts to install dependencies to build lesson files like [`nodejs`][nodejs], [`npm`][npm],  and [`hjson`][hjson].
